Frontend of the website
1.	HOW TO RUN THE WEBSITE LOCALLY
The website can be accessed via chrome browser or any browser that is well updated 

2.	REFERENCES USED
We have referred to the internet for better understanding of the framework . We have gone through the codes given on various website as we are in our first year and are not very equipped with the various tools available .
Websites referred - 
•	Tailwindcss 
•	Tail blocks
•	W3 school
•	Unsplash
  
3.	CSS/JS FRAMEWORKS
Tailwind CSS was released & it barely made a soft thud, and the ecosystem gave it no attention; and rightly so, given that tailwind was neither backed by a tech giant nor had the push of a massive marketing budget. Besides, with Tailwind, you didn’t get a Bootstrap-like experience, something that had (or maybe still is) become the norm.
In fact, Tailwind advocated a style of writing and using CSS that sent many screaming in disgust
4.	JUSTIFICATION
Our project justifies the theme as it contains all the necessary details of a furniture website like shopping cart, user profile, etc.
It also holds a discount coupon as well.
